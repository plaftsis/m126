## Aims of the project
In this project we aim to examine the evolution of shooting in the NBA League by visualizing shots made during the last two decades through shot charts. The application allows users to filter by season starting from 2000-01, favorite team or even a specific player.

## Target audience
The target audience of this project includes NBA and basketball viewers, as well as sports fans in general. However, we aim to also attract data enthusiasts, as we believe this specific case study could clearly demonstrate the amazing benefits of data visualization.

## Significance of the work
In the past few years, we have seen various statistics showing the NBA audience all the new 3-point records and how differently the 3-point line is used now. Last season, the Houston Rockets became the first team in NBA history to attempt more 3s than 2s over a full schedule. More than a third of all shot attempts over the past two seasons have been 3s. Before this decade, no individual team had taken such a high percentage of its shots from range in a single season. We believe that visualizing this exact pattern provides a clear view of the NBA 3-point shot being a game changer.

## Dataset
The dataset was exported from the publicly available data found in the <a href="https://stats.nba.com/"><strong>official NBA stats website</strong>
